# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

## ❌ **Current Issue**
The GitHub Actions are failing. Let's fix this step by step.

## ✅ **Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/DicksonLegend/To-Do-List-App
2. **Click Settings** (top menu)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Configure as follows**:
   ```
   Source: GitHub Actions
   (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   ```
5. **Click Save**

## ✅ **Step 2: Fix Package Dependencies**

The build might be failing due to dependencies. Let's check and fix:

1. Check if `package-lock.json` exists
2. If missing dependencies, we'll add them

## ✅ **Step 3: Commit Fixed Workflow**

The updated workflow should work better now:
- Simplified build process
- Combined build and deploy job
- Uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

Once you commit the workflow fix, it should:
1. Build successfully
2. Deploy to: `https://dicksonlegend.github.io/To-Do-List-App/`

## 🆘 **If Still Failing**

Check the Actions tab for specific error messages and we can debug further.

**Let's commit this fix and try again!**
